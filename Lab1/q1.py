#   1. Write a program to find the:
#      a. Sum,
#      b. Difference,
#      c. Product,
#      d. Integer quotient,
#      e. Remainder
#      f. Fractional quotient
#      of two numbers. Enter the numbers on run time. Display the
#      input data and results in neat format



# solution


a=int (input ("enter the value of a : "))
b=int (input ("enter the value of b : "))

sum = a+b
print ("The sum of a and b is : ",sum)

difference = a-b
print ("The difference of a and b is : ",difference)

product=a*b
print ("The product of a and b is : ",product)

division=a/b
print ("The division of a and b is : ",division)

integerQuotient= a//b
print ("The integer quotient of a and b is : ",integerQuotient)

remainder=a%b
print ("The remainder of a and b is : ",remainder)
