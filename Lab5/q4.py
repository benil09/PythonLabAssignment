"""
Create a program that manages employee salaries in a company using a
dictionary. The dictionary should contain at least 5 employees, with their
names as keys and their respective salaries as values [take user input data].
Implement a sorting algorithm to arrange the employees in descending order
based on their salaries without using any built-in sorting functions, and
display the sorted list along with their salaries and rank (highest salary first
and so on). [Hint: check the second parameter of the enumerate function].
E.g.

1. Cummins: Rs. 5000
2. Head: Rs. 4500
3. Maxwell: Rs. 2500
4. Narine: Rs. 1100
5. Rashid: Rs. 890
